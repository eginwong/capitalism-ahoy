## TODO

### FEATURES

- TODO

### LIMITATIONS

- `Trade` can only allow up to a maximum of 35 options. Anything above 35 will cause the game to throw an exception.
  - mitigation: the maximum number of available assets for trade in a regular game is 32 (29 for properties, 1 for cash, 2 for cards).
  - cause: due to underlying limitation of `readline-sync` library

### ARCHITECTURE

[Architecture Documentation](./Architecture.md)

### REFLECTIONS

- dependency on UI
- issues with event-driven architecture with dependencies
  - UI
- generators are cool üßêüßêüßêüßêüßê
- pre-condition testing for event-driven architecture
