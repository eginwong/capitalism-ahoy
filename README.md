  - Players
  - BONUS:
    - liquidity
      - cannot trade with other players
    - bankruptcy
    - interactivity
      - trade
      - sell
      - auction
- TODO: Pass in options to set fine/go parameters/max houses
- TODO: House service to manage property purchasing/global maximums
- Q: does gamestate have dependency on house service (so that it knows how to set playeractions for buy house if available)? Or should that be on the property service?

### ARCHITECTURE
- Services
  - BuildingService (buy/sell houses, enforce housing limits, handle buy/sell logic)
    - requires propertyService OR gameState
  - PropertyService (lookup of position <-> property, calculates rent, handles auctions/purchases/sales of property)
  - CashManagementService (networth calculation, increment, decrement, liquidation, bankruptcy)
    - Q: need to know when to calculate networth
    - requires player
  - CardService (community chest, chance, randomly draws card from open deck, shuffles)
    - 
- PlayerActions
  - main actors
- Events
  - main actors
- GameState
  - glue
- Game
  - glue, configuration, start/continue
- main
- TODO: One-Pager Architecture Write-up :: Keegan


### CODE
- ~~TODO: testing framework~~
- ~~TODO: TDD/BDD (given when then), integration testing framework~~
- ~~TODO: chalk for console UI + testing~~
- ~~TODO: set up travis ci for test coverage check~~
- TODO: linter
- TODO: prettier
- TODO: [add check for if there are formatting changes outstanding on build](https://github.com/yyx990803/yorkie)
- ~~TODO: look into removing gameState from PlayerActions#execute by passing it in~~
- TODO: continue gamestate (check PropService?)
- TODO: validate GameState
- TODO: use inquirer for prompts instead
- TODO: Investigate using Mocha's reporter flag for NYC
- TODO: Refactor Mocha-bloat (not a Mocha-Float); leverage modules

### REFLECTIONS
- dependency on UI 
- issues with event-driven architecture with dependencies
  - UI
- generators are cool üßêüßêüßêüßêüßê
- pre-condition testing for event-driven architecture
